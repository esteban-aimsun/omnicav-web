The development of CAVs offers an opportunity to dramatically redesign the way we approach transport in urban and rural environments across the UK. Drawing on experience from the public, private and academic sectors, OmniCAV’s objective is to accelerate the development of safer, smarter mobility by providing an end-to-end framework for the testing and certification of autonomous vehicles (AVs). 

OmniCAV was awarded funding as part of a competition run by the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV). With expertise across the country and from multiple disciplines, the 10-strong consortium, which is jointly funded by industry partners and Innovate UK, will spend 24 months developing a market-first simulation platform that can be used by accreditation bodies, insurers and manufacturers to accelerate the development and certification of AVs.

On a broad scale, the project addresses one of the ‘Grand Challenges’ the UK Government set out in its 2018 Industrial Strategy - the future of mobility. Having started in December 2018 the consortium will work together until November 2020, when the project will culminate in an autonomous vehicle being put through the entire end-to-end OmniCAV testing programme in a public demo, from simulation, to proving grounds, all the way through to public roads.
