  title1: What does OmniCAV stand for?
  description1: OmniCAV means Connected Autonomous Vehicles for All. Derived from the latin word for “all”, the use of Omni operates on several levels; it relates to an inclusive project that will meet the needs of all road users, all end users and all situations. CAV stands for connected and autonomous vehicle. The developments in connectedness and autonomy go hand in hand and are mutually enabling. OmniCAV will focus particularly on the aspect of autonomy, but through this will accelerate the deployment and development of vehicles that are both connected and autonomous.

  title2: Where is the project taking place?
  description2: Given the distributed nature of the consortium, work on the project will be taking place across the country. However, the main focus is in and around Oxfordshire. The county is a hotbed of CAV innovation and the home of project lead, Latent Logic, and the project partners RACE and Arrival. On-road testing for the project will take place in Oxfordshire at the final stage of the project.

  title3: Who is leading the project?
  description3: Latent Logic, a spin-out of the award-winning Computer Sciences department at Oxford University, specialising in the simulation of realistic human behaviour within virtual environments, is leading the consortium.

  title4: How is the project funded?
  description4: OmniCAV was awarded £2.7m in government funding as part of a competition run by the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV) and Innovate UK. This represents 70% of the total project cost of £3.9m, with the remaining 30% being contributed by the consortium partners. The competition was created to assert the UK’s position as a world leader in the future of mobility.

  title5: When will the project take place?
  description5: The project started in December 2018 and will run until November 2020, when the culmination of two years’ work will be presented. Key milestones for the project include - Public engagement event (Winter 2019) - Simulator developed (Summer 2020) - Public demo (Winter 2020)
