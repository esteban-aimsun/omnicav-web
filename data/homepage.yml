    content: "OmniCAV is a consortium of ten world-leading organisations working together
      to develop real-world validated simulation-based framework for the testing and
      certification of autonomous \x03vehicles (AVs) in the UK. "

  - title: Why?
    icon: images/omnicav-icons2.png
    content: AVs have the potential to deliver safer, smarter, autonomous mobility
      for all. But first we need to know that autonomous vehicles can handle challenging
      road conditions, on country lanes as much as crowded city streets. Testing this
      on public roads alone is not safe or scalable.

    content: 'Funded jointly by Innovate UK (70%) and the project partners (30%),
      OmniCAV is drawing on experience from across the AV ecosystem to create a realistic
      simulation that will enable accurate, reliable, and scalable testing of autonomous
      vehicles in a risk-free virtual environment. '
